# Anatomy of a Healthy Security Operation

## Some definitions & things you may hear

- CISO/CSO: Chief Information Security Office / Chief Security Officer
- SIEM: Security Information Event Management
- Events: Single events represented as data, such as a log line from a program
- NIST: US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
- ISO27001: ISO 27001 (formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005) is a specification for an information security management system (ISMS)
- IOC: Indicator of Compromise - an IP, hash, etc. which is "known-bad"

## NIST Cybersecurity framework

This is one of the frameworks that can be used for healthy security operations.

- [Framework PDF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf)
- Framework core functions:
  Identify, Protection, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Maturity/Implementation tiers:
  - T1: Partial
  - T2: Risk Informed
  - T3: Repeatable
  - T4: Adaptive

## Incident Response typical steps

1. Identification
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery
5. Lessons learned


## SIEM's typical capabilities

- Record incidents, live, automatically, in a collaborative manner
- Help investigation with a fast, powerful event search engine
- Assists forensics (same as above)
- Alert on known IOCs or patterns
- Take automatic containment actions where possible
- Assist manual blocking and containment
- Dashboards, reporting, metrics, visualizations
